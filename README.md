picker.DisplayAlbumsNumberOfAssets = true;

//Customize the picker title and prompt (helper message over the title)
picker.Title = "Custom title";
picker.CustomNavigationBarPrompt = "Custom helper message!";

//Customize the number of cols depending on orientation and the inter-item spacing
picker.ColsInPortrait = 3;
picker.ColsInLandscape = 5;
picker.MinimumInteritemSpacing = 2.0f;

//You can pick the smart collections you want to show:
picker.CustomSmartCollections = new [] { PHAssetCollectionSubtype.AlbumRegular, PHAssetCollectionSubtype.AlbumImported };

//Disable multiple selecion
picker.AllowsMultipleSelection = false;

//Show a promt to confirm single selection

//Select the media types you want to show and filter out the rest
picker.MediaTypes = new [] { PHAssetMediaType.Image };

//Switch the sort order of the photos grid
picker.GridSortOrder = SortOrder.Descending; // (=newest on top); SortOrder.Ascending (oldest on top) is the default

//UI color & text customizations
picker.PickerBackgroundColor = UIColor.Black;
